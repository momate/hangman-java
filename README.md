# Hangman #

## About ##

This is a simple Hangman game written in Java.
It was a very basic, old project, with just one main methode. I started to rewrite in the OOP way to see what would become of it.

Currently it only has a console view,but later I planning to add maybe a Swing or Browser view.

## Description ##

The program guesses a random word and the user has to suggest letters one by one. 
Every time the word contains a letter, the letter is appear in the right place. Every time the word doesn't contain a letter, the user loses a life. If there are no hidden letters anymore, the program else the user loses.

## TODO ##
- [] Difficulty levels
- [] Unit tests
- [] More andvanced view
